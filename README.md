## There's Wally

An experiment in using a Convolutional Neural Network to find Wally in Where's Wally images.

The code is based on @HTuennermann's code for detecting and locating cars, available here: https://github.com/HTuennermann/Vehicle-Detection-and-Tracking

## Installing dependencies

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Starting the Jupyter notebook server

```
$ jupyter notebook
```

## Training the network

Run the `train` notebook.

You'll need a bunch of images that I can't share on GitHub for copyright reasons.

## Using the pre-trained network

1. Save your Where's Wally image as `test.jpg` in the root folder of this repo.

2. Run the `find-wally` notebook.
